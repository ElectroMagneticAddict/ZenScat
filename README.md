# ZenScat

2D Fourier Modal Method solver with implemented validations

The ZenScat application is a compiled distribution that is for academic sharing. It calculates diffraction efficencies of periodic structures, such as diffraction gratings, guided mode resonance filters, etc. Archived Python files are constructions of devices and their sub layer thicknesses and generate .mat files, which are imported via the second application. The third application calculates field distributions in one period of a grating.
