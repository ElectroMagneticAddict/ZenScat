# ZenScat

2D Fourier Modal Method solver with implemented validations

The ZenScat application is a compiled distribution that is for academic sharing. It calculates diffraction efficencies of periodic structures, such as diffraction gratings, guided mode resonance filters, etc. Archived Python files are constructions of devices and their sub layer thicknesses and generate .mat files, which are imported via the second application. The third application calculates field distributions in one period of a grating.

General prerequisites for the application are: “Matlab Runtime” (User Interface is constructed on Matlab's 2023b version). Runtime download and use instructions for different platforms (Windows®, Linux®, macOS) are publicly available following this link together with instructions: https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html
To run ZenScat access the .zip archive and navigate to:
\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation.zip\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation\ZenScat UI\Distribution Files
Then access either:
\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation.zip\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation\ZenScat UI\Distribution Files\for_redistribution
and run “MyAppInstaller_web.exe” ; or
\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation.zip\ZENSCAT + Python Data Generation\ZenScat UI\Distribution Files\for_redistribution_files_only
and run “Zenscat.exe”.
